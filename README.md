# Information for LibreKancolle

LibreKancolle is the free software alternative to the original Kantai Collection game (2013)

### Reasons of a complete rewrite by the author:

The original Kantai Collection game is proprietary and is effectively SaaSS(Service as a Software Substitute) as a web game that requires little interactions between different users. Thus the dangers of proprietary software and SaaSS stated by the Free Software Foundation applies(The authors does think positions taken by FSF as seen on their website is too strict though), and a free alternative will be a valuable contribution to the free software community.

The original servers is obviously not meant to be maintained forever. While the data of millions of users on the original servers cannot be saved in case of "death of Kancolle", the Kancolle community and its culture must be saved in some manner, requiring another form of the game.

The limited time of the events are considered undesirable and the author wish to keep events maps forever (although must be in a modified form).

The extremely frequent and long delays of maintenance time prior to any events leads to high levels of frustration and negative sentiment towards the coders (this is from the perspective of the Chinese Community)

The inactiveness of certain artists and voice actors is blocking certain Ship girls from getting an Kai Ni. It's desired to give users the freedom of creating their own Kai Ni (not necessarily being widely recognized).

The severe low probability of certain drops, or ships not being re-available for years (e.g. Iowa before 2018) further adds the urgency for the users to have their own freedom.

### Features proposed by the new system:

LibreKancolle will try to adhere to FSF guidelines and will be released under GNU Affero General Public License.

The core part of LibreKancolle will be a command-line interface program. An external GUI will be developed later.

The complete game logic and mechanism of the original Kancolle will not be honored here, since not all of them are transparent. The authors reserve the right to honor, modify, or discard features at will.

The original ship girl graphics and voices, being not marked free, is not possible to become part of this program. In the later stages of development a system will be established to allow users use their own installed resources (image and voice). Since creating another version of all graphics and voices is very expensive and breaks user experience for those familiar with old Kancolle, usage of original ones (present on kancolle.fandom.com etc.) is expected to be widespread. Due to their unclear copyright status, users is at their own risk in this scenario.

Before the death of the original server, this program will be updated according to (but not strictly copy) the updates of the original server. After that, an entirely independent evolving path will be pursued.

### Release date

Due to the author's limited spare time, the development of LibreKancolle is expected to be very challenging and slow, similar to Mental Omega. The first fully functional release is expected at no later than December 2024 (hopefully before the death of original Kancolle)

### A call to arms

Anyone with love for Kancolle and programming expertise (especially those worked with Kancolle browers and plugins in the past, but notice your experience may not be useful since this is a complete rewrite) may join the team.

LibreKancolle is expected to be written in Qt-based C++ or Python.
