ÉVARISTE GALOIS CLAUSES
Version 1, 11 June 2021

Copyright (C) 2021 LI ShangYing <dbpr@mail.ustc.edu.cn>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is NOT allowed.

Preamble

A large number of free software is licensed under "GPLv3 or later" while
others are not. Your licensing terms are essentially indeterminate when
choosing the former option, which is not worrisome for its proponents, since
such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but
superior in details. Additionally, no additional obligations are imposed
on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

The author of this clause places extremely high confidence in FSF for
maintaining the four essential freedoms in GPLv3 and any later versions:

The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does
your computing as you wish (freedom 1). 
The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
others (freedom 3).

However, improbable things happen. <19a>Huawei thought one day they might be 
sanctioned, but never thought Google (a "DON'T BE EVIL" one!) would deny them
the Android ecosystem entirely AND get away with it. Since D. Trump, people
worldwide suspects even western democracies can take actions once considered
unthinkable.</19a> External forces taking over FSF and sabotaging GPLv3 or any
later version turning it into a non-free one would bring more damage to mankind
than two nukes as almost the entire mankind have to interact with systems that
contains some GPL software, but the possibility cannot be ignored in legal
considerations.

<19a>In fact, prominent Chinese IT people once commented that the Chinese
software industry is in fact so vulnerable that if US denied them usage of GNU
Compiler Collection alone it would entirely cease to function.</19a>

Therefore, should anyone compels or convinces FSF to abandon its principles
or destroys FSF through force, the copyright holder(s) of this project, in the
name of Évariste Galois who once said "To Louis-Philippe, if he betrays",
solemnly declare:

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

18. No Surrender of Others' Freedom, Even by FSF if it's Compelled to Betray
(s'il trahit)

If the Federal Government of the United States or any other entity(s) in the
world (OFFENDING PARTY) compel, convince or destroy the Free Software
Foundation so that from the offender's viewpoint, the terms and conditions of
GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE version 3 or later, as applied to this
project, legally changed, not similar in spirit to the version 3 as stated in
November 19, 2007, but causes said license to violate anyone's essential
freedom:

(1)The freedom to run this program as you wish, for any purpose. (i.e., Any
prohibition of this program for any purpose, if they exist at all, should
never be a part of said license)

(2)The freedom to study how this program works, and change it so it does
your computing as you wish.

(3)The freedom to redistribute copies of this program so you can help others.

(4)The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
others.

OR:

(5)Changes the copyright holder(s) of this software project through the new
license.

(6)Imposes additional obligations on any author or copyright holder.

Then the terms and conditions of this program should be construed as the 
GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, version 3 or later (at your choosing)
before said change, applying worldwide. 

19a. Legal Actions in Case of License Nuclear War (AFSL)

<19a>
If the OFFENDING PARTY is foreign vis-à-vis with the People's Republic of
China, for the purpose of Articles 12 and 15 of the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law
of People's Republic of China as published June 10, 2021, said freedom-
violating change to GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSEs is considered by
copyright holder(s) of this program to be a "discriminatory restriction
measure" against all citizens of and organizations in People's Republic of
China who adheres to this clause.

Said citizens and organizations may reserve the right to take legal actions
against enforcers of the new non-free license imposed by the OFFENDING PARTY
vis-à-vis this program under said Articles 12 and 15., even before actions are
taken against said "discriminatory restriction measures" under Articles 4, 5
and 6 of the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law of People's Republic of China.

Surrendering of rights of any author or copyright holder(s) of this project
enshrined in Article 7 and 32 of the Data Safety Law of People's Republic
of China as published June 10, 2021 by non-free future versions of GNU AFFERO
GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE is not permitted and will trigger 18. as if imposing
additional obligations on any author or copyright holder.
</19a>

Notwithstanding any other provision of this ÉVARISTE GALOIS CLAUSES, Any
distributor of this program may drop content in this document marked in 
<19a></19a> and still claim compatible adherence with ÉVARISTE GALOIS CLAUSES
(changing 19b to simply 19 is not allowed), but the name of your document must
be modified, as changing this document is not allowed.

Nothing in this document shall be construed as endorsement OR condemnation
by the copyright holder of this document or this project, of the parts of said
Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law and Data Safety Law that are not included in the
appendixes of this document.

Nothing in this document shall be construed as endorsement OR condemnation
by the copyright holder of this document or this project, of the political
views of the Free Software Foundation.

19b. Legal Actions in Case of License Nuclear War (Normal)

<19a>Regardless if the above 19a. applies to the copyright holder(s),
including if the OFFENDING PARTY is domestic vis-à-vis with the People's
Republic of China,</19a> the copyright holder(s) reserve the right take legal
actions against OFFENDING PARTY to preserve the above mentioned four freedoms,
restore their legal copyright holder status, or to free themselves from the
above mentioned additional obligations.

20. Scope of Licenses.

The GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE in any other provision of this ÉVARISTE
GALOIS CLAUSE may be replaced with GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, GNU LESSER
PUBLIC LICENSE, or GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE if you adhere to one or more
of the said licenses in your project, for the same effect, and notwithstanding
the copyright notice of this document. When not being used together with any of
the four licenses, this ÉVARISTE GALOIS CLAUSES is NULL AND VOID IN ITS
ENTIRETY.

21. Scope of legal meaning change.

The GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE changing legal meaning within any local
jurisdiction of one of the copyright holder(s) of this project rather than
worldwide is still enough for 18. and 19. to be active, in which case any
entity that causes said change that violate the freedoms and rights outlined in
18. is considered the OFFENDING PARTY for the purpose of 18. and 19. even they
do not directly or indirectly controls the Free Software Foundation.

Section 18. and the above continues to apply even if the Free Software
Foundation is acting on its own, which will result in the OFFENDING PARTY being
itself.

22. The GNU AFFERO-GALOIS GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Upon successful legal actions under <19a>19a. or</19a> 19b. in any
jurisdiction, you have the option to combine GNU AFFEROS GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
and this document into a single document as The (GNU) AFFERO-GALOIS GENERAL
PUBLIC LICENSE with the Free Software Foundation to be construed as any former
members and supporters that still respects the four freedoms in the preamble.

Further changes to either document and altering their copyright holders is
not allowed in order to still claim adherence to this clauses.

23. Évariste Galois Clauses as a permissive additional term

Nothing in this ÉVARISTE GALOIS CLAUSES shall be construed or enforced as
further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under
GNU AFFERO PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 as published 19 November 2007.

Although the author of this document considers this document essential for
any country's software industry's RIGHT TO EXIST against any unlawful
sanctions:

Any distributor of this program can drop this ÉVARISTE GALOIS CLAUSES and
only adhere to GNU AFFERO PUBLIC LICENSE version 3 with or without any later
versions, which is considered relicensing, even if it isn't a restriction
described in section 10. in the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Concluding statement

The FSF thinks copyright laws and governments can be evil. Natually when we
think the FSF itself can (albeit on a ridiculously small possibility) also turn
evil, then it can have a future forever for freedom.

The contents of this ÉVARISTE GALOIS CLAUSES is an absolute natural
consequence of section 14. in the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, and have
absolutely no chance of activation when the GNU Licenses is unchanged or 
is changed in a manner consistent with section 14.
