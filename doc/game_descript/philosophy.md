> Teitokus are to be taught that if Tanaka knew the exactions of the event-designers, he would rather that 1:1 Zuiun Model should go to ashes, than that it should be built up with the skin, flesh and bones of supporters of his game.

Although it's widely considered miraculous that Kancolle survived this far, playing it in 2020 (at least if one is interested in Difficulty A in events) is a significantly more arduous (and somewhat less rewarding) experience compared to 2014. Not everyone have so much time for maximum resource-gathering and begin an event with 350,000 start; in old times retrying tens of times for AL/Mi E-6 is infamous enough but now with 2500+ resources per trial it's more mentally crushing. Being an event explorer is more so.

This project is not an Kancolle emulator. [It's already been done](https://github.com/fourinone41/kancolle-replay), not to mention reusing and copying assets, mechanics and world settings _en masse_ is potentially term-infringing. This is a game design from scratch and the goal is to create something more enjoyable for us accustomed to Kancolle culture, especially after Kancolle ceased to exist.
