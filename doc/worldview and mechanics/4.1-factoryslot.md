# Factory and its Slots

In this game both developing equipment and constructing ships take factory slots. Unlike in KC, developing equipment in this game takes time.

You have 4 initial slots [Implemented in User::init] and a maximum of 24.

Additional slots are unlocked by passing Sortie map areas (not DLC maps) for the first time. [NOTYETIMPLEMENTED]
