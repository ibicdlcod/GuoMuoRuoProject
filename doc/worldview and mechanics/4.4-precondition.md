# Normal preconditions (father)

[Implemented in Server::dodevlop#father_required]

An equipment may have 0~2 "father"s. You cannot develop an equipment if you don't possess all its "father equipment"s.

# Special preconditions (mother)

[Implemented in Server::dodevlop#mother_required]

An equipment may have 0~1 mother. A successful development of equipment consumes some skill points (details later) of the mother equipment [Implemented in Server::newEquipHasMother], and you must possess such skill points at the mother equipment to develop it.

### Required skill points

[Implemented in Server::newEquipHasMotherCal] The required skill points are
$$
\text{Points} = st^a(1+b(\arctan(\frac{c}{x})-\arctan(1))
$$
$s$: [Standard skill points of son equipment](4.5-skillpoints.md)

$t$: Son equipment's tech level

$a$: [rule/motherspscale](settings.md)

$b$: [rule/maxskillpointsamplifier](settings.md)

$c$: [rule/normalproductionstockpile](settings.md)

$x$: Normal possessing limit of son equipment

# Virtual preconditions

As a special instance of special preconditions, virtual preconditions represent extraordinary resources, represented by skill point of this condition, but you can't develop this condition like an equipment.

[NOTIMPLEMENTED] National preconditions have their skill points gained by sortieing maps that have said nationality as a factor.

[NOTIMPLEMENTED] Exotic type preconditions have their skill points usually granted by quests.
