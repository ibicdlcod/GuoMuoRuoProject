# Normal preconditions (father)

An equipment may have 0~2 "father"s. You cannot develop an equipment if you don't possess all its "father equipment"s.

# Special preconditions (mother)

An equipment may have 0~1 mother. A successful development of equipment consumes some skill points (details later) of the mother equipment, and you must possess such skill points at the mother equipment to develop it.

The required skill points are 

std * pow(tech, 0.2) * (1 + 5.0 * (atan(30/x)-atan(1)))

Where std is the standard skill points of son equipment, tech is tech level, x is maximum stockpile of son equipment,

# Virtual preconditions

As a special instance of special preconditions, virtual preconditions represent extraordinary resources, represented by skill point of this condition, but you can't develop this condition like an equipment.

National preconditions have their skill points gained by sortieing ships of said nationality.

Exotic type preconditions have their skill points usually granted by quests.
