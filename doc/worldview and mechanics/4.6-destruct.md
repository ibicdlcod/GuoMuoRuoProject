# Destruct equipment

You can destruct equipment in factory/arsenal view for half of the resources used to develop it.

Destructing equipment not only does not have any other benefits (there isn't a hard equipment count cap like KC, but the cap is specific to each equipment) but lower your tech level. It is advised not to destruct equipment that is even remotely close to your current tech level.
