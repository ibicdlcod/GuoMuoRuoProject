# CyberFleet 2141

This project is a open source experiment in ship games.

## A message from the future

On August 24, 2023, TEPCO started to direct radioactive water due to the accident to Pacific Sea amid controversy. Defenders are trying to downplay the effect, but "won't make the sea dead waters" doesn't let dumping 1,000 tons of oil into sea become legitimate.

But this is not the biggest catastrophe.

The worst thing is TEPCO is totally clueless about the internal state of the said Power Plant and therefore failed to keep the promise of successfully decommission it within 30 years. Everybody forget about it and went to their own business.

The deepest parts of the ocean is one of the least known parts to mankind.

By the time the "Amnesiac Fleet" blocks the seas to mankind, everything seems to be too late...

## The world of this game

If not for the "Kanmusu"s who represent the memories of parts of this world they are named after.

Goal: collect Kanmusus and their equipment, defeat the Amnesiac Fleet on high seas to reclaim it for mankind, and eventually restore mankind's industrial and technological capacity to clean harmful man-made radioactivity from earth!
