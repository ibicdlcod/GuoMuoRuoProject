# Capital-ness and fleet type[NOTYETIMPLEMENTED]

In this game normal fleet and striking force fleet are the same.

Each type of ship have fleet size contribution (capital ships are greater) listed below. Some type are subtypes and add/subtract from base type, the end result is shown in parentheses.

Having a healthy capital ships to screens ratio is crucial.

### Fleet types

|       Type       | Max ships | Fleet size requirement |                             Note                             |
| :--------------: | :-------: | :--------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|      Normal      |     7     |          <20           |          The Nishimura fleet is a typical example.           |
|  Surface strike  |    14     |         15~50          | Size contribution from battleship/heavy cruiser types must be greater than carrier/light carrier types |
|  Carrier mobile  |    14     |         15~50          |                     Oppose of the above                      |
| Transport Escort |    14     |          <25           | Size contribution from light cruiser/destroyer/escort types must be greater than battleship/heavy cruiser/carrier/light carrier types |
