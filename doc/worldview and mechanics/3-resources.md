# Resources

It's been said the core of KC is resource management, and this game inevitably inherits this characteristic.

Base resource type is 7 compared to 4 in KC. However other resource types are simplified. For example, you just pay double resources plus a fixed percentage of the ship's construction costs to instantly repair a ship instead of spending a bucket. [NOTYETIMPLEMENTED]

Base resource type is Oil, Explosives, Steel, Rubber, Aluminum, Tungsten, and Chromium. They function similarly to Hearts of Iron IV. Beware that you should perceive 1 ordinary resource in KC as 10 resources in this game!

All ordinary resources are capped absolutely at 3600000.

## You gain resources by:

### Natural regeneration

Natural regeneration speed is the following per minute:

10 + power for Oil, Explosives, Aluminum (capped at 2500 * (globaltechlevel * 8 + 24));

5 + power for Aluminum (capped at 2000 * (globaltechlevel * 8 + 24));

###### 2 + power for Rubber, Tungsten and Chromium (capped at 1500 * (globaltechlevel * 8 + 24));

Power is your global tech level divided by 4.0.

### Naval Supremacy [NOTYETIMPLEMENTED]

1000(ordinary)/750(aluminum)/500(rare) per naval area having supremacy every day at 05:00 server time. This amount is only affected by absolute caps, but you need to sortie to these areas every month to maintain it.

### Expedition [NOTYETIMPLEMENTED]

## You spend resources by:

- Develop equipment
- Improve equipment
- Construct ships
- Supply ships
- Repair ships
- Sending LBAS

Details will be explored later.
