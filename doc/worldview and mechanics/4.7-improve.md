## Improvement [NOTYETIMPLEMENTED]

You can improve any equipment at the cost of 100% of standard skill point per star. An equipment improved [Star] times would have its efficiency amplified by
$$
m=\frac{s}{\sqrt{s^2+1}}\cdot(\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}-\frac{1}{2}),s=\text{Star}/a
$$

times.

$a$: [rule/equipmentstandardstar](settings.md)

The maximum star for any equipment is unlimited (unlike 10 in KC).

Like in KC equipment require one of some specific ships to be present. This also means some equipment require yet-to-be-released ships and thus cannot be improved for now.
