# Development

Unlike in KC when you specify resources and may get various equipment (or penguin) depending on many factors, in this game you must specify an equipment definition and develop for that specifically.

See [technology](2-technology.md) for the success rate of a development attempt.

Most equipment have a maximum stockpile, you can't develop it if you reached it.

## Resource cost

Cost = base cost * (equip tech level + 1.0) * 10.

See Equiptype::devResBase() for base cost for each type of equipment.
