# Development

Unlike in KC when you specify resources and may get various equipment (or penguin) depending on many factors, in this game you must specify an equipment definition and develop for that specifically.

### Possess limit

[Implemented in Server::doDevelop#possess_limit]

Most equipment have a maximum stockpile, you can't develop it if you reached it.

### Success rate

See [technology](2-technology.md#Success rate)

### Resource cost

[Implemented in Equipment::devRes]
$$
\text{Cost} = a\text{Round}(c(t+1))
$$
$a$: base cost, varies by equipment type [Implemented in Equiptype::devResBase()]

$c$: [rule/devresscale](settings.md)

$t$: equipment's tech level

### Development time

[Implemented in Equipment::devTimeInSec]


$$
\text{Time(second)} = b\text{Round}(c(t+1))
$$
$b$: [rule/devtimebase](settings.md)
