# Equipment skill points

Unlike in KC where only planes have skill levels, in this game all equipment have them.

Same model of equipment share skill points.

### Standard skill points

[Implemented in Equipment::skillPointsStd]

Each equipment have a standard skill point determined by its tech level:
$$
\text{Stand skill points}=ba^{t}
$$
$b$: [rule/skillpointbase](settings.md)

$a$: [rule/skillpointfactor](settings.md)

$t$: tech level

### Gain

[NOTYETIMPLEMENTED] Gain: equal to kanmusu that mounted this equipment, unless its "mother" is a real equipment, then it gain (1/tech) as many skill points in battle but can transfer skill points from its "mother equipment" at a ratio of (\sqrt{tech of "son equipment"} : 1)

#### Development fail

[Implemented in Server::doFetch#consolation_skill_points]

When failing to develop an equipment, you get
$$
\text{Consolation skill points}=\frac{s\arctan(\frac{t_{current}+1}{t_{equip}+1})}{a}
$$
$s$: equipment's standard skill points

$a$: [rule/penguinskillpointsdifficulty](settings.md)

$t_{equip}$: equip's tech level

$t_{current}$: your global tech level

### Loss

[NOTYETIMPLEMENTED] Loss: Kanmusu mounting it get medium damage: ?x (TBD); heavy damage: ?x(TBD)

### Effects

[NOTYETIMPLEMENTED] At 0% stand skill points the equipment is 29.29% effective, at 100% points 100% effective. Maximum effectiveness (without improvement) is 129.29% (2-\sqrt{0.5}). Therefore an inferior equipment with enough skill points may outperform a superior but unskilled one.
$$
\text{Efficiency} = 1-\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}+\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\space+m
$$

$x$: standard skill point for this equipment

$y$: actual skill point for your equipment

$m$: [improvement factor](4.7-improve.md)

total efficiency therefore cannot exceed 150%.
