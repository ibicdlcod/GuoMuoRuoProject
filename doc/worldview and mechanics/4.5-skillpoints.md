# Equipment skill points

Unlike in KC where only planes have skill levels, in this game all equipment have them.

Each equipment have a standard skill point determined by its tech level:
$$
S=(1.25)^{tech}\times10000
$$
[NOTYETIMPLEMENTED]Gain: equal to kanmusu that mounted this equipment, unless its "mother" is a real equipment, then it gain (1/tech) as many skill points in battle but can transfer skill points from its "mother equipment" at a ratio of (\sqrt{tech of "son equipment"} : 1)

[NOTYETIMPLEMENTED]Losses: Kanmusu mounting it get medium damage: ?x (TBD); heavy damage: ?x(TBD)

At 0% stand skill points the equipment is 29.29% effective, at 100% points 100% effective. Maximum effectivenes (without improvement) is 129.29% (2-\sqrt{0.5}). Therefore an inferior equipment with enough skill points may outperform a superior but unskilled one.
$$
Efficiency = 1-\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}+\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\space+improvement factor
$$

where x=stand skillpoint, y=actual skillpoint
